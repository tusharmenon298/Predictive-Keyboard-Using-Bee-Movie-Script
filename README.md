# A Predictive Keyboard based on the Bee Movie Script using Deep Learning

In this project, we are gonna use the entire Bee Movie script to create a predictive keyboard We use the Recurrent Neural Network for this purpose. This model was chosen because it provides a way to examine the previous input. LSTM, a special kind of RNN is also used for this purpose. The LSTM provides the mechanism to preserve the errors that can be backpropagated through time and layers which helps to reduce vanishing gradient problem
